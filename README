KAMAILIO (OPENSER) Devel Guide
===================

1. Structure
------------

The guide is structured in chapters. Each chapter name starts with cXY, where
the XY is a number that ensures the same order on the file system as it is in
the book.

To add an intermediate chapter, please use cXYZ to add it in between cXY and
cXY+1. The first digit to be used as Z is 5 to allow space for including new
chapters before or after.

2. Writing
----------

The book is written in DocBook XML format. It is important that you specify
an unique ID for chapters, sections and examples, so that the links are
persistent over updates. The format of the ID is cXYid (where cXY is from
the file name, id is something related to section name).

3. Output
---------

There is a Makefile that helps generating the HTML format -- just type 'make'.
You need xsltproc and DocBook XSL files. A file named 
'kamailio-devel-guide.html' is generated in the same directory.

The HTML output can be browsed online at:
  * http://www.asipto.com/pub/kamailio-devel-guide/
